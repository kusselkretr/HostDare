# From Zero to API Mastery: Transforming Web Data into Personal Resources

## **Introduction**

Programmers often joke among themselves: "Programming is simply calling various APIs." While this might sound self-deprecating, thereâ€™s a lot of truth to it. Whether itâ€™s the classic beginner's line of code, `print("hello world")`, or an application with complex interactive logic, APIs play an indispensable role. But what exactly is an API? How does it work? And how can we harness its power to turn web data into our own resources? Let's explore.

## **What is an API?**

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of predefined functions that allow applications and developers to access specific routines of software or hardware without needing to understand their underlying workings. Letâ€™s use a real-world analogy: imagine your house suddenly loses power. What would you do? Most people would simply call the electrician, describe the problem, and provide their address. The actual repair process is handled by the professional.

In this scenario:
- Calling the electrician is like **calling an API**.
- The parameters you provide (e.g., "repair" and your address) correspond to the input for the API.
- The restored electricity is the **output** or response of the API.

Hereâ€™s a pseudo-code version of this analogy:

```python
def call_electrician(purpose, address):
    # Electrician arrives
    # Repairs the issue

    return "Electricity restored"
```

Every time there's a power outage, you just need to call the "electrician function" without worrying about the tools or methods used for the repair. Similarly, when working with APIs, you only need to focus on two things:
1. **The APIâ€™s endpoints and parameters.**
2. **What the API does (its purpose).**

APIs often refer to communication methods between a server and client, like RESTful APIs, GraphQL, and gRPC. These are like invisible "threads" weaving the fabric of the internet.

> **RESTful, GraphQL, and gRPC**: These are protocols for designing and implementing APIs. They provide standardized ways to define and access services or resources, facilitating interoperability and decoupled systems.

## **Capturing APIs**

APIs are invisible yet ever-present. Every time we click a button or press "Enter," countless tiny threads work in the background to fetch the data displayed in your browser. Capturing these threads allows us to access those resources without even using a browser. There are three main methods to capture APIs:

1. Reviewing official API documentation.
2. Using F12 developer tools to inspect web pages.
3. Utilizing packet capture tools.

### **1. Reviewing Official API Documentation**

The easiest and most reliable method is to check whether the platform offers API documentation. Many major platforms, such as [Notion](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro), [QWeather](https://dev.qweather.com/docs/start/), and [iFlytek](https://www.xfyun.cn/), provide comprehensive developer guides.

When reading official documentation, focus on these points:
- **Authentication Mechanism**: Most APIs require authentication, such as a `bearer token` for verifying user identity and access validity.
- **Endpoints**: Understand the purpose of each endpoint, including its URL, request methods, required/optional parameters, and response structure.
- **Response Format**: Learn about error response formats and common error codes for debugging.
- **Rate Limits**: Platforms often impose call limits to avoid server overload. Knowing these limits can help prevent service interruptions.

Paying attention to these details can significantly accelerate your development process and minimize errors.

### **2. Using F12 Developer Tools**

Not all platforms provide detailed API documentation. For such cases, browser developer tools (accessible via F12) are invaluable for uncovering how a webpage works. These tools allow developers to inspect a websiteâ€™s HTML structure, CSS styles, JavaScript code, and network requests. Here's how to use them for API discovery:

1. Open the browserâ€™s developer tools and navigate to the **Network** tab.
2. Refresh the webpage to capture all network requests.
3. Filter the captured requests by selecting **Fetch/XHR**, as these typically include API interactions.

Clicking on any request will reveal details such as:
- **HTTP Method**: The operation type (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Request URL**: The target resourceâ€™s address.
- **Request Headers**: Includes additional information like:
  - `Accept`: Specifies acceptable response content types.
  - `Content-Type`: Specifies the format of the request body.
  - `Authorization`: Provides authentication details.
  - `User-Agent`: Provides client-specific information.
- **Request Body**: Data submitted to the server for POST or PUT requests.
- **Query Parameters**: Extra data appended to the URL in GET requests.

#### **Example: Analyzing a Request**
Suppose youâ€™re exploring the [SSPai](https://sspai.com) website and want to capture the API used for its search feature:
- Navigate to **Network > Fetch/XHR** while using the search bar.
- Youâ€™ll find a request with a URL like:
  `https://sspai.com/api/v1/search/article/page/get?free=1&title=browser&stime=0&offset=0&limit=8`

Breaking it down:
- `title=browser`: The search term (encoded in URL format).
- `limit=8`: Limits the number of results to 8.
- `offset=0`: Indicates the starting point for results.

By experimenting with these parameters in tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), you can better understand the APIâ€™s functionality.

### **3. Using Packet Capture Tools**

For mobile apps or platforms without a web version, packet capture tools like **Fiddler** (Android) or **Stream** (iOS) are useful. Unlike browser tools that display decrypted HTTPS communication, packet capture tools intercept encrypted data packets, requiring additional setup.

- Install the packet capture app and configure its **CA certificate** to decrypt HTTPS traffic.
- Start capturing packets and monitor network activity to identify APIs.

> **Tip**: Only use trusted capture tools to avoid security risks.

## **Leveraging APIs: Build Your Personal Information Hub**

In todayâ€™s era of information overload, switching between platforms like Twitter, Zhihu, and SSPai can be time-consuming. By leveraging APIs to scrape and aggregate trending content, you can create a personal information hub on your blog or notes app.

### **Example: Zhihuâ€™s Hot Topics API**
Zhihuâ€™s trending topics are accessible via this API:  
`https://www.zhihu.com/api/v3/feed/topstory/hot-lists/total`

Parameters include:
- `limit`: Number of results.
- `desktop`: Indicates whether the request is from a desktop client.

Hereâ€™s a simplified **Node.js** script to extract Zhihuâ€™s trending topics:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function getZhihuHotList() {
    const hotList = [];
    const response = await axios.get('https://www.zhihu.com/api/v3/feed/topstory/hot-lists/total');
    response.data.data.forEach((item) => {
        hotList.push({
            title: item.target.title,
            link: `https://www.zhihu.com/question/${item.target.id}`
        });
    });
    return hotList;
}

getZhihuHotList().then(console.log);
```

This script fetches the trending topics and converts them into an array of titles and accessible links.
