## Executing a Request

To retrieve news data, you'll need two mandatory parameters: `api_key` and `engine`. For this example, weâ€™ll also include optional parameters like `q` (query) and `gl` (geolocation).

### Example: Fetching News Articles

```javascript
const { getJson } = require("serpapi");

getJson({
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  engine: "google_news",
  q: "coffee",
  gl: "us"
}, (json) => {
  console.log(json);
});
```

With just this snippet, youâ€™ll receive a structured JSON response containing the latest news articles for your query.

## Response Breakdown

The JSON response from the Google News API contains two primary sections:

### 1. `news_results`

This section includes the main data for each article:

- **Title**: Headline of the article
- **Source**: Publisher name and author information
- **URL**: Link to the article
- **Thumbnail**: Thumbnail image URL
- **Publication Date**: Timestamp for the article

For example, searching for "NBA Playoffs" may group results by topic, with individual articles listed in a `stories` array.

### Example Code: Topic-Based Search

```javascript
getJson({
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  engine: "google_news",
  q: "NBA Playoffs",
  gl: "us"
}, (json) => {
  console.log(json);
});
```

### 2. `menu_links`

Google News organizes articles by broader topics such as Business, Technology, or Entertainment. These topics appear under `menu_links` in the response, providing quick filters for more targeted searches.

Each topic includes:

- **Title**: Topic name
- **Topic Token**: Unique identifier for executing filtered requests
- **SerpApi Link**: Pre-generated API request link for further exploration

## Best Practices for Scraping News Data

### 1. Respect Website Rules

Always check the `robots.txt` file of a site to ensure compliance with its policies.

### 2. Manage Rate Limits

Use rate limiting to avoid overwhelming servers with excessive requests. Leverage tools like `serpapi` to handle these efficiently.

### 3. Handle Errors Gracefully

Implement retries and error handling to ensure your scraper can adapt to unexpected issues.

### Example: Error Handling

```javascript
async function fetchWithRetry(params, retries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < retries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const response = await getJson(params);
      return response;
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(`Retry ${attempt + 1} failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
  throw new Error("Max retries reached");
}
```
