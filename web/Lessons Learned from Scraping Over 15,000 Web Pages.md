# Lessons Learned from Scraping Over 15,000 Web Pages

## Introduction

Scraping 15,000 web pages may sound like a small number in the grand scheme of the web, but the insights gained from such an exercise are invaluable. In my journey of building a Python app to collect and share data science content on Twitter, I gathered thousands of articles, videos, and blog posts. Here's a breakdown of the lessons I learned during this process.

## Finding Pages to Scrape Is an Art

### Challenges of Sourcing URLs
Finding the right URLs to scrape is a task in itself. While social media platforms like Twitter are a great starting point, they come with their own challenges:
- **Irrelevant Links:** Many tweets either lack URLs or link to unrelated content.
- **Spam Content:** Certain keywords (e.g., "entrepreneurship") attract spammy "get rich quick" schemes.
- **Duplicate URLs:** Popular links are often tweeted repeatedly, making it hard to gather diverse content.

### Alternative Methods
To diversify your sources, you can scrape well-known platforms like:
- **YouTube** for videos.
- **Reddit** for discussions and recommendations.
- **RSS Feeds** from your favorite blogs.

## Challenges with Scraper Design

### Building a Basic Scraper
Using Python, I relied heavily on:
- **`requests`** for making HTTP requests.
- **`BeautifulSoup`** for parsing HTML.

These tools are powerful but require careful handling to avoid errors.

### Lessons Learned
1. **Large Files Cause Problems:**  
   Some URLs link to ZIP files, massive PDFs, or Google Docs. Trying to load these into `BeautifulSoup` can crash your script or server. Check for file size limits using the `content-length` header.

2. **Sites That Reject Scrapers:**  
   While most sites tolerate scraping if you don‚Äôt overload them, some block bots unless you use headers to mimic human behavior. Despite this, I prefer to be transparent by identifying myself in headers.

3. **Hosting Challenges:**  
   If you're scraping at scale, switch from shared to private servers to avoid interruptions.

## The Diversity of Websites Is Refreshing

From scraping 15,000+ URLs, I discovered over 3,000 unique domains. Surprisingly, there wasn‚Äôt much dominance from large, well-known sites. For niche topics like data science, personal blogs and independent creators often outshine mainstream platforms like the Wall Street Journal.

### URL Distribution
The variety of domains was both refreshing and challenging, as each required its own handling for metadata extraction and page structure.

## Open Graph: A Blessing and a Curse

### What Is Open Graph?
Open Graph is a protocol that provides metadata (e.g., title, image, author) for social media sharing. It simplifies scraping by standardizing key information.

### Limitations of Open Graph
1. Only about **80% of pages** support Open Graph.
2. Open Graph properties alone aren‚Äôt sufficient for in-depth analysis. For example, data geeks like me often need raw HTML for custom metadata extraction.

---

## Paywalls Aren‚Äôt a Big Issue

Don‚Äôt let paywalls deter you. Even for premium sites, you can often extract basic metadata (like Open Graph properties) without encountering issues.

---

## Regularly Revise Your Scraper Logic

Scraping isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù process. Regularly review and update your scraper to improve its performance:
- **Fallback Logic for Missing Metadata:** If `og:title` is unavailable, extract the `<title>` tag as a backup.
- **Handling Large Files:** Ignore pages without a `content-length` header or implement chunked reading for safer parsing.

---

## Key Takeaways

Web scraping is one of the most effective ways to gather data for analysis, content curation, and research. While there‚Äôs no single ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù approach, adhering to best practices, acting ethically, and continuously refining your logic will ensure long-term success.
