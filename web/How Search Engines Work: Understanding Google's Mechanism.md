## What is a Search Engine?

> A search engine is a system that collects information from the internet using specific strategies and computer programs. It organizes and processes this information to provide users with relevant search results. ‚Äî *Baidu Baike*

In simple terms: A search engine is a tool for finding and ranking web pages that match a user's search query.

For example, if you want to know the tallest building in the world, you can enter ‚Äútallest building in the world‚Äù in Google‚Äôs search box. After pressing enter, the search results (SERP) will display accurate information related to your query.

## How Search Engines Work

Search engines operate by using web crawlers to crawl, index, and rank pages. Different search engines have unique crawler names:
- **Google**: Googlebot
- **Baidu**: Baiduspider
- **Bing**: Bingbot

## How Google‚Äôs Search Engine Works

According to Google‚Äôs official SEO guide, its search process includes three key stages:

### 1. Crawling
Google uses automated tools called ‚Äúcrawlers‚Äù to discover web pages, downloading text, images, and videos from the internet.

### 2. Indexing
Crawled content is analyzed and stored in Google‚Äôs database (Google Index). Text, images, and metadata like `<title>` tags and alt attributes are processed to understand page content.

### 3. Ranking Results
When users search on Google, the search engine returns relevant results based on user intent.

## How Google Crawls Pages

Googlebot crawls your website, continuously discovering and extracting information such as text, images, and videos. However, crawlers have **crawl budgets**, meaning they may not crawl every page on a site. Optimizing your site for efficient crawling is essential.

---

## How Google Builds Indexes

After crawling, Google organizes information into its index by analyzing textual and multimedia content, meta tags, and attributes. Indexed pages become eligible for **SERP rankings**, but inclusion in the index doesn‚Äôt guarantee a top ranking.

### How to Check If Your Pages Are Indexed
1. **Use the `site:` Operator**: Enter `site:yoururl.com` in Google‚Äôs search box to view indexed pages.
2. **Use Google Search Console (GSC)**: Paste your URL in GSC‚Äôs search bar to see its index status.

## How Google Ranks Pages

Ranking determines where your page appears in search results. Google evaluates hundreds of factors, including user intent, content quality, and backlinks, to decide rankings.

### Key Ranking Factors:
1. **Search Intent**
   Google prioritizes pages that align with the user‚Äôs intent. For example:
   - Searching for ‚Äúhow to use a computer‚Äù returns guides and tutorials.
   - Searching for ‚Äúbuy a computer‚Äù displays e-commerce sites.

2. **Content Quality and Relevance**
   Pages with well-written, user-focused content rank higher. Avoid black-hat techniques like keyword stuffing, which can lead to penalties.

3. **Backlink Authority**
   Backlinks act as ‚Äúvotes‚Äù for a page‚Äôs credibility. High-quality backlinks improve rankings, while low-quality ones have minimal impact.

4. **Page Speed**
   Faster-loading pages enhance user experience and rank higher. Use Google‚Äôs [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to test your site speed and improve performance.

## Personalized Search Results on Google

Google personalizes search results based on factors like IP address, device type, language, and search history. For example, searching for ‚Äúlocal restaurants‚Äù in California will display nearby dining options, complete with maps and ratings.
