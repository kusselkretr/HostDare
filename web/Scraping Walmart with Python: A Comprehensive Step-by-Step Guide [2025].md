## Why Scrape Walmart?

Web scraping Walmart allows you to:
- Analyze competitive pricing in real time.
- Monitor product availability and reviews.
- Collect structured product information for analysis.

In this guide, we'll walk through the step-by-step process of building a Walmart scraper, avoiding detection, and storing the data in a structured format like CSV or JSON.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following in place:

1. **Python Installed**  
   Run this command to verify your Python installation:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   If Python is installed, you'll see the version number.

2. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Use `pip` to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Project**  
   Create a directory for your scraper and open a Python file (`scraper.py`) using your favorite IDE.

You're now ready to start coding!

## Step 2: Scraping Walmart Product Data

### Target Product Page

For this tutorial, we'll scrape data from this Walmart product page:  
[Logitech MX Master 3S Wireless Performance Mouse](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Logitech-MX-Master-3S-Wireless-Performance-Mouse-Ergo-8K-DPI-Quiet-Clicks-USB-C-Black/731473988)

We'll extract:
- Product name
- Price
- Images
- Description
- Reviews

### Step 2.1: Retrieve Page HTML

Start by fetching the HTML of the target page using Python's `requests` library:
```python
import requests

url = "https://www.walmart.com/ip/731473988"
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36"
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

#### Potential Blockages
If Walmart detects your request as a bot, you'll encounter a CAPTCHA page. To bypass this, use a scraping API like ScraperAPI or implement proxy rotation and user-agent spoofing.

---

### Step 2.2: Extract Product Information

Once you've successfully retrieved the HTML, parse it using `BeautifulSoup` to extract specific data points.

#### Extract the Product Name
The product name is located in an `<h1>` tag with the ID `main-title`:
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
product_name = soup.find("h1", {"id": "main-title"}).get_text(strip=True)
print(product_name)
```

#### Extract the Product Price
The price is stored in a `<span>` tag with the attribute `itemprop="price"`:
```python
price = soup.find("span", {"itemprop": "price"}).get_text(strip=True)
print(price)
```

#### Extract Product Images
Images are stored in a carousel container with the attribute `data-testid="vertical-carousel-container"`:
```python
carousel = soup.find("div", {"data-testid": "vertical-carousel-container"})
images = [img["src"] for img in carousel.find_all("img")]
print(images)
```

#### Extract the Product Description
The description is within a `<span>` tag with the ID `product-description-atf`:
```python
description = soup.find("span", {"id": "product-description-atf"}).get_text(strip=True)
print(description)
```

#### Extract Product Reviews
Reviews are located in separate `<div>` tags with specific class names. Loop through each review to extract its heading, rating, and body:
```python
reviews = []
review_blocks = soup.find_all("div", class_="flex flex-start flex-column pa0 mb4-l self-stretch-l")
for block in review_blocks:
    rating = block.find("div", class_="star-rating").get_text(strip=True)
    review_body = block.find("p").get_text(strip=True)
    reviews.append({"rating": rating, "body": review_body})

print(reviews)
```

## Step 3: Export Data to CSV

To save the scraped data for future use, export it to a CSV file using Python's `csv` module:
```python
import csv

data = {
    "product_name": product_name,
    "price": price,
    "images": images,
    "description": description,
    "reviews": reviews,
}

with open("walmart_data.csv", "w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(data.keys())
    writer.writerow(data.values())
```

---

## Step 4: Scraping Multiple Pages

Walmart's search results pages allow pagination. By modifying the URL, you can scrape multiple pages of product listings. For example:  
Page 1 URL: `https://www.walmart.com/search?q=mouse&page=1`  
Page 2 URL: `https://www.walmart.com/search?q=mouse&page=2`

Use a loop to iterate through the pages:
```python
base_url = "https://www.walmart.com/search?q=mouse&page="
for page in range(1, 11):
    url = base_url + str(page)
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    products = soup.find_all("div", class_="ph0-xl")
    for product in products:
        product_url = "https://www.walmart.com" + product.find("a")["href"]
        print(product_url)
```

## Step 5: Simplify Scraping with ScraperAPI

Manually handling anti-bot solutions can be challenging. ScraperAPI simplifies this process by managing proxies, CAPTCHA handling, and JavaScript rendering.

### Benefits of ScraperAPI:
- **Handles Anti-Bot Measures**: Avoid detection with rotating proxies and user-agent rotation.
- **Supports JavaScript Rendering**: Access dynamic pages.
- **Scalable Requests**: Extract data from multiple pages seamlessly.

Hereâ€™s how to integrate ScraperAPI:
```python
scraper_api_url = "https://api.scraperapi.com"
params = {
    "api_key": "SCRAPE9837861",
    "url": "https://www.walmart.com/ip/731473988",
    "render": "true",
}
response = requests.get(scraper_api_url, params=params)
print(response.text)
```

## Conclusion

Scraping Walmart with Python enables access to invaluable product data for businesses and researchers. While Walmartâ€™s anti-bot systems can present challenges, strategies like proxy rotation, CAPTCHA solving, and APIs like ScraperAPI ensure smooth data extraction.
