## Quickstart

### Using Docker (Recommended)

Google Maps Scraper is dockerized for easy setup across multiple platforms.

Run the scraper using Docker:
```bash
touch results.csv && docker run -v $PWD/example-queries.txt:/example-queries -v $PWD/results.csv:/results.csv gosom/google-maps-scraper -depth 1 -input /example-queries -results /results.csv -exit-on-inactivity 3m
```

This will generate a `results.csv` file containing parsed data.

**Optional**: To include email extraction, use the `-email` parameter:
```bash
docker run -v $PWD/example-queries.txt:/example-queries -v $PWD/results.csv:/results.csv gosom/google-maps-scraper -depth 1 -email -input /example-queries -results /results.csv -exit-on-inactivity 3m
```

---

### Using Command Line

Install and run the scraper directly on your host system (tested on Ubuntu 22.04):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper.git
cd google-maps-scraper
go mod download
go build
./google-maps-scraper -input example-queries.txt -results results.csv -exit-on-inactivity 3m
```

Results will be saved to the `results.csv` file.
