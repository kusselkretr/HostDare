## **What is Googlescraper?**

Googlescraper (also referred to as the **Lippmannian Device**) queries Google and analyzes the presence and relevance of specific keywords within a given set of URLs. By inputting a list of source URLs and keywords, Googlescraper evaluates how frequently and prominently those keywords appear within the specified web pages. The results are visualized through tag clouds, HTML tables, or downloadable text files for further analysis.

## **Important Updates**

The original Googlescraper tool has been deprecated. Instead, two new tools now serve its purposes with enhanced functionalities:
- [**Search Engine Scraper**](https://www.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/ToolSearchEngineScraper): Use this tool for analyzing overall search engine results for a given query or set of queries.
- [**Lippmannian Device**](https://www.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/ToolLippmannianDevice): Ideal for analyzing query results on a per-site basis.

## **Key Features and Workflow**

### **1. Input Sources and Keywords**
- Add a list of **URLs** in the top input box (these are your source sets).
- Add **keywords** in the bottom input box. Googlescraper checks whether each keyword appears in each URL.

### **2. Harvester Functionality**
- Input a combination of text and URLs. The tool automatically extracts URLs from the provided text and evaluates them based on the keywords entered.

### **3. Output Results**
Results are presented in multiple formats:
- **Tag Cloud**: Displays keyword occurrences visually.
- **HTML Table**: Organizes data for easier analysis.
- **Text File**: Downloadable for offline analysis.

## **Example Use Case**

Googlescraper has been used for projects like **censorship research** and **source distance analysis**. For example:

### **Researching "Synthetic Biology"**
1. Query Google with "synthetic biology."
2. Copy the top 100 URLs into Googlescraper's source box.
3. Add "Venter" as the keyword in the keyword box.
4. Generate a tag cloud to analyze how often "Venter" appears across the top URLs.
